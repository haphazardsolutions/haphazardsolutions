We've recently made the decision to release all of our internal code into the public domain (excluding anything contractually protected by a client relationship, of course).

As a pilot, our analysts are refactoring the [fakesmrt](https://github.com/haphazardsolutions/fakesmrt) LLM model-mixing application to operate outside of our internal *blobjectdb* ecosystem. We hope it's useful, or -- ideally -- it inspires something better!

## Projects

- [fakesmrt](https://github.com/haphazardsolutions/fakesmrt) - Our LLM model-mixing framework. Train _a lot_ of stupid AIs. Then merge and evolve them into something useful. Upscale basic semantics to domain-specific expertise.
- fuzzyreaper - Fuzzy is an autonomous agent that persistently picks through your data store and identifies content redundancy. For example, do you have a text file sitting in your training data that is just one chapter clipped from another text file right next to it? Are these two images identical, except one is 4K and one is 320x240? Fuzzy'll figure it out. (coming soon)
- hyperwave - Intelligently and losslessly transform data among relational, dimensional, graph, blobjectdb, and JSON forms. (coming later)
- blobjectdb - Code is data, data is code. blobjectdb is the architecture underlying all of our more advanced applications. (coming much later)
